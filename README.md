<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ali Bayat <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></h1>

<p>For over 10 years my passion has been creating software applications for small to enterprise-sized companies.</p>

<p>I've been honored to have participated in several successful projects as a <b>.NET Developer</b>. I've been fortunate enough to work with the best developers in my country. But my work is not limited to creating Web Applications. I have a special passion for sharing my knowledge, so I spend part of my time training colleagues and Junior developers.</p>

<p>The development of the eCommerce project, an online supermarket, has been completed and has entered the testing and debugging phase. So <b>I'm looking for a new job as a Back-end .NET Developer</b>.</p>

<p>Most of my ability to write code comes from my work with some of the best software development companies. I've had the privilege of coding with the best programming teams and gaining different knowledge for writing applications. I've used this distinction to deliver consistent positive results and help companies continually grow and develop.</p>

<p>One of the things I'm most proud of is writing free books. I've always believed that if we're blessed enough to have learning opportunities, we're also blessed enough to give back. To those who much has been given, much is expected. I'm extremely blessed to be able to write a book every year and publish it for free on the internet.</p>
